          3D Computer Animation and Architectural Design Instructor brings a wealth of knowledge in the areas of fine art,
        architecture, industrial design, drafting, engineering, and computer animation to San
          Diego County. He heads up the Computer Animation and Architecture Design Lab (Studio)
        following industrial&nbsp;trends and innovations. The Lab is outfitted with industrial
        standard software and hardware used in Hollywood, game houses, and many engineering firms across the
        nation. His&nbsp;renaissance and avant-garde
        approach, toward the field of computer graphics, 3D computer animation,
          game development, architecture and engineering has launched students into their
          field of choice. He is also the Advisor for the 3D Computer Animation and Robotics Club on
        campus.<br>
  
        <p>For
        the last 10 years, Rodger has been a leader in the nation for his
        model 3D Computer Animation (formerly titled Computer Design &amp; Virtual
        Reality) and Pre-Engineering &amp; Design curriculum, through the nationally recognized Poway Unified
        School District. His curriculum follows and interest based renaissance
        approach for kids, that allows them to adopt their own interests and
        knowledge base into the field of entertainment and engineering design. 3D
        Computer Animation and Architecture Design meet the UC/CSU 'f' fine art credit.&nbsp;
        Whereas Pre-Engineering &amp; Design meets the UC/CSU 'g' elective credit. Many of Mr. Dohm's graduated students are currently working in the field of
        engineering, architecture and computer graphics/animation locally and abroad,
        while many others are in trade schools, or attending colleges and universities. Mr. Dohm's current 3D Computer Animation and Architectural
        Design courses have an articulation agreement at Palomar College and students receive
        college credit for taking the course(s) with a B or better.&nbsp; The credit is
        transferable to any UC or CSU institution.&nbsp; 
        <br>
        <p>Prior to teaching, Mr. Dohm double majored at Brigham Young
        University and received a Bachelor of Arts in
        the field of Math and Art Education. He follows a Discipline Based Art Education and product development approach toward
        the field of computer animation and architectural design. He also holds an
        MA in Educational Leadership from Point Loma Nazarene University.</p>
